# Ɔkyeame Config (Agent Configuration)
# English: How agents interact with Nsumankwahene flow system
# 
# This file is read by agents (Claude, Copilot) to understand
# how to select work, when to request human input, and how to
# transition issue states.

        ⚠️ **Asiw (Blocked): No activity for 5 days**
        
        This issue has been in Dwuma (In Progress) for more than 5 days without activity.
        
        Please:
        1. Check the Nkabom (Dependencies) field for blockers

      - "Check for nnipa-gyinae-hia label - if present, do NOT proceed"
      - "Check for Tech Design Needed label - if present, verify design is approved"
      
    # When encountering blockers:
    on_blocker:
      - "Set Nsoromma to Asiw (Blocked)"
      - "Update Nkabom field with blocker issue numbers"
      - "Add comment explaining the blocker"
      - "Assign to @hoopsomuah"
