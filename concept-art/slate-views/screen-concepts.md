# Watchtower Tablet UI Concepts

Based on the Akan-inspired "Watchtower" design language, here are conceptual descriptions for additional tablet screens ("Slate Views"). These designs maintain the "Operation Sentinel" aesthetic—holographic gold/wood textures, glowing blue/amber UI elements, and Adinkra symbolism—but flattened for clear UI visualization.

## 1. The Linguist's Interface (Ɔkyeame View)
**Purpose:** Human-in-the-loop interaction and translation.
*   **Header:** "INTERPRETER LINK ACTIVE" with the *Poma* (Staff) symbol.
*   **Central Area:** A chat/dialogue stream. Unlike standard chat, messages are grouped by "Intent" and "Translation".
    *   *Left side:* Raw data stream (Agent Protocol).
    *   *Right side:* Human-readable summary (The Linguist's translation).
*   **Footer:** Input area with "Proverb Selectors" (Context macros) instead of just a text box.
*   **Visuals:** Gold leaf borders with speech-scroll motifs.

## 2. The Treasury Dashboard (Gyasehene View)
**Purpose:** Resource allocation and budget monitoring.
*   **Header:** "ROYAL TREASURY" with the *Adaka Kese* (Great Chest) icon.
*   **Main Metric:** A large central gauge showing "Compute Reserves" and "Token Budget".
*   **Grid:** "Expenditure by Company" (Agent groups).
    *   *Asafo A (Research):* High usage (Amber warning).
    *   *Asafo B (Execution):* Nominal usage (Blue stable).
*   **Visuals:** Bar charts stylized as stacked gold weights.

## 3. The Council Chamber (Mpanyimfo View)
**Purpose:** Distributed decision-making and consensus logs.
*   **Header:** "COUNCIL SESSION: IN PROGRESS" with the *Sika Dwa* (Golden Stool) watermark in the background.
*   **Layout:** A circular visualization of active agents (The Council).
    *   Lines connect agents currently negotiating.
    *   "Consensus Strength" meter showing how close the system is to a decision (0-100%).
*   **Sidebar:** "Dissent Logs" – listing agents that disagreed with the primary plan and their reasoning.

## 4. The Asafo Deployment Grid (Warrior Companies)
**Purpose:** Agent orchestration and task status.
*   **Header:** "TACTICAL DEPLOYMENT" with *Frankaa* (Flag) icons for each active company.
*   **Map/Grid:** A flat tactical map (similar to the Sentinel view but zoomed out).
    *   Shows "Companies" (groups of agents) moving towards "Objectives" (Data nodes).
*   **Status List:**
    *   *Scout Company:* "Infiltrating"
    *   *Guard Company:* "Holding Perimeter"
    *   *Logistics Company:* "Resupplying Context"

## 5. The Spiritual Shield (Nsumankwahene View)
**Purpose:** System health, error trapping, and security.
*   **Header:** "SPIRITUAL WARD" with protection symbols (*Gye Nyame*).
*   **Central Visual:** A shield diagram showing "Integrity Layers".
    *   Outer ring: API Connection Health.
    *   Inner ring: Logic Consistency.
    *   Core: Data Sanctity.
*   **Alerts:** "Impurity Detected" (Anomalous token generation or hallucination warning).
