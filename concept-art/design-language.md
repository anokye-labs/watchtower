# Watchtower Design Language System (DLS)

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Ancestral Futurism"

The Watchtower UI merges the organic, authoritative weight of Akan tradition with the precision of advanced AI orchestration. It is not just a "skin" but a translation of social structures into digital interfaces.

* **Principle:** *Sankofa* ("Go back and get it"). We use ancient symbols to explain modern complexity.
* **Vibe:** High-tech holographic projections anchored by warm, physical materials (wood, gold).

## 2. Color Palette

### The Royal Spectrum

* **Ashanti Gold (#FFD700)**: Used for primary headers, "Royal" agents (Chiefs/Treasurers), and critical alerts. Represents authority and wealth (resources).
* **Holographic Cyan (#00F0FF)**: The primary color for active data streams, agent movement, and "living" information. Represents the spirit/soul (*Sunsum*) of the machine.
* **Deep Mahogany (#4A1812)**: Used for UI containers, borders, and structural elements. Represents the physical grounding of the tablet/slate.
* **Void Black (#050508)**: The background canvas. Deep, infinite, allowing the holograms to pop.
* **Alert Amber (#FF8C00)**: Warnings, resource depletion, or high-stress agent negotiations.

## 3. Typography

* **Headers (The Voice):** Strong, geometric sans-serif (e.g., *Rajdhani* or *Orbitron*). Uppercase, wide tracking. Used for "OPERATION SENTINEL", "COUNCIL SESSION".
* **Data/Code (The Whisper):** Clean monospace (e.g., *JetBrains Mono* or *Fira Code*). Used for logs, JSON streams, and agent protocols.
* **Body (The Script):** Readable, modern sans-serif (e.g., *Inter* or *Roboto*). Used for summaries and human-readable translations.

## 4. Iconography & Symbology (Adinkra UI)

Adinkra symbols are not just decoration; they are functional UI icons.

* **Gye Nyame (Except God):** *Security/System Health*. Used for the "Spiritual Shield" dashboard.
* **Sankofa (Heart/Bird):** *History/Logs/Undo*. Used for accessing past states or "retrieving" context.
* **Dwennimmen (Ram's Horns):** *Strength/Conflict*. Used for the "Warrior" (Asafo) deployment views.
* **Bi Nka Bi (No one bites another):** *Harmony/Consensus*. Used to show agreement between agents.
* **Dame-Dame (Checkers):** *Strategy/Intelligence*. Used for the map/grid views.

## 5. Materiality & Texture

* **Digital Wood:** UI panels should have a subtle wood grain texture, treated to look like it's under a glass surface or projected.
* **Gold Leaf Inlay:** Borders of active windows glow with a metallic gold shader.
* **Holographic Glass:** The content sits on "layers" of light. Background elements are blurred (frosted glass), foreground elements are sharp neon.

## 6. Layout Patterns

* **The Council Circle:** For decision-making screens, avoid lists. Use radial layouts where nodes (agents) sit around a center (the problem).
* **The Weaver's Grid:** For data-heavy screens (Treasury), use a grid structure inspired by Kente cloth patterns—interwoven blocks of data rather than a simple Excel sheet look.
* **The Linguist's Staff (Navigation):** The main navigation bar is vertical (like a staff), usually on the left or right edge, containing the primary "Proverb" icons for switching views.
